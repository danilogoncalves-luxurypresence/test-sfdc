<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
<br />
Our Billing Team let me know that your last payment didn’t go through, so I wanted to send a quick note to check in.<br />
You can update your card information or make a payment from your <a href="https://users.instapayments.io/luxurypresence/secure/login">Client Billing Portal</a>. If you could send me a note once you’ve done that, it’ll help us ensure that your services stay on track.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need any help or have any questions!<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
{{{Sender.Name}}}<br />
