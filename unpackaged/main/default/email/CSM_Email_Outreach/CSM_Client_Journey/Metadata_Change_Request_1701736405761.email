<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{recipient.first_name}}},<br />
<br />
We can make the update you requested, but wanted to give you a heads up that you may see an impact on keyword rankings and organic traffic, since metadata has a significant impact on click-through rate.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We follow these guidelines when optimizing your meta titles and descriptions:<br />
<br />
* Titles are 45-60 characters<br />
* Descriptions are 145-160 characters<br />
* Target keywords are included when possible<br />
* Copy tells the user exactly what the page they're about to click on is about<br />
<br />
If you're ok with this, we'll go ahead and make the update. Note that it may take a few days to a week to reflect on the front end.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
