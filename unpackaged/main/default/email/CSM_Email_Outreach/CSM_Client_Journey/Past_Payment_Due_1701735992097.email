<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{recipient.first_name}}},<br />
<br />
This is a quick note to let you know that your payment is past due for website services, including blog content and Google Business Profile optimizations. The last charge failed on [date] and we have not yet received a response from your team.<br />
<br />
Let me know if there have been any changes on your team and if we need to update any contact or billing information. I'm happy to facilitate a conversation with our Billing Team to resolve this matter. I can also advise on your domain renewal so you can get your website back up and running.<br />
<br />
Please call me or email me as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
