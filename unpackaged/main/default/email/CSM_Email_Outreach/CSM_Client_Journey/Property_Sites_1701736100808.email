<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dedicated Property Sites are microsites for your listings that are designed to convert potential clients who are interested in a specific property. In other words, they're not built for "discovery" searches from users who have a broader interest in the market. Rather, they are intended for those who may be ready to commit to a real estate transaction.<br />
<br />
In terms of SEO, these sites aren't meant to rank for broader location-based keywords such as "Long Lakes Estates homes for sale" or "Boca Falls homes for sale.‚Äù That's what Neighborhood/Pillar pages are for! Dedicated Property Sites target very specific search queries, which usually include the address of the property.<br />
<br />
While these sites can get clicks organically through the aforementioned address searches, it is highly recommended that you feature them in newsletters, social media posts, and so on. They are more likely to get high quality clicks/engagement from users who are already aware of your brand and are "in the market."<br />
<br />
All that said, these sites can contribute to the overall SEO of your main website through interlinking. We recommend including at least one link to an associated Neighborhood page, your About Us page, or your Home Page on each Dedicated Property Site. The anchor text of the link (the word or phrase someone clicks to open the link) should be a targeted real estate keyword. This won't have a huge impact on SEO, but it should help.<br />
<br />
In summary, Dedicated Property Sites are conversion tools first and foremost. They are good for ranking for specific property address searches, but they are at their most effective when used in conjunction with other marketing campaigns (email newsletters, social media, etc.<br />
