<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}<br />
<br />
I noticed you haven’t activated our new Neighborhood Data feature yet.<br />
<br />
The feature lets you add School Data, Walkability Scores, and Demographic and Employment Data to the Neighborhood pages of your website.<br />
<br />
It is great for SEO and will help you rank for more local search terms. It’s included free of charge with your current plan with us.<br />
<br />
Since launching the feature, over 5,000 of our clients have already enabled it on their websites to grow their Google rankings.<br />
<br />
Would you like me to add it to your website?<br />
<br />
Best,&nbsp;<br />
