<p>Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},</p>

<p>I’m your Customer Success Manager here at Luxury Presence. I’m committed to helping your team excel. &nbsp;Based on your team size and transaction volume, you qualify for a limited promotion we’re offering until <strong>111/10.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
We’ll set up complete, personalized websites for each of your agents – hosted on subdomains under your main website. We’ll waive any setup cost and reduce the monthly to <strong>just $15/month per website.</strong><br />
<br />
Most agents love getting their own website and see this as an incredible value-add. Many of our clients use this as an easy way to attract, reward, and retain their agents.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Just complete this <a href="https://form.jotform.com/232846774860165">30-second order form</a>&nbsp;to move forward. I’ll handle the build-out so we won’t need much of your time.<br />
<br />
Best,</p>

<p>{{{Sender.Name}}}</p>
