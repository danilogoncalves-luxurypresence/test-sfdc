Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

To answer your question regarding how the One-Click Property sites may affect clicks and SEO:

One-Click Property sites are microsites that are honed to convert potential clients who are interested in a specific property. In other words, they're not built for "discovery" searches from users who have a broader interest in the market, but rather, they're there to serve users who may be ready to commit to a real estate transaction.

Regarding, One-Click Property sites in terms of SEO, they aren't meant to rank for broader location-based keywords such as "Long Lakes Estates homes for sale" or "Boca Falls homes for sale"â€”that's what Neighborhood/Pillar pages are for. But rather, they target very specific search queries, usually the property's address, e.g., "8495 Twin Lake Drive". 

While these sites can get clicks organically through the aforementioned address searches, it is highly recommended that you feature them in newsletters, social media posts, and so on. They are more likely to get high-quality clicks/engagement from users who are already aware of your brand and are "in the market."

All that said, these sites can contribute to the overall SEO of the main website through interlinking. We recommend including at least one link to an associated Neighborhood page, the About Us page, or the Home Page on each One-Click Property site. The anchor text of the link should be a targeted real estate keyword. This won't have a huge impact on SEO, but it should help.

In summary, One-Click Property sites are conversion tools first and foremost. They are good for ranking for specific property address searches. Still, they are at their most effective when used in conjunction with other marketing campaigns (email newsletters, social media, et cetera).

Hope this helps. Please let us know if you have any other questions.

Best,
