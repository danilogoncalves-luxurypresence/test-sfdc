Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Excluded by 'noindex' tag" refers to a situation on a website where certain web pages or content are intentionally excluded from being indexed by search engines, like Google. However, there are cases where website owners or administrators may not want certain pages to show up in search results, and is used as a valid and purposeful tactic. This could be because the content is temporary, duplicate, irrelevant, or for other reasons.
