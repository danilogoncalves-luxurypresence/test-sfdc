Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for reaching out to us!

As part of your plan, we provide quarterly reports, and we have been working to enhance our reporting system to provide you with more comprehensive and insightful data about your SEO performance. Our goal is to offer a more detailed and valuable report to you, and you will receive this report soon. So, please lookout for this. 

In the meantime, we are attaching your 90-day over 90-day comparison Google Analytics Report to cover a quarter. Comparing SEO data over a 90-day period offers a more comprehensive view, capturing seasonal variations, statistical significance, and the impact of algorithmic updates, providing a more reliable assessment of overall performance. This approach helps businesses identify stable trends, user behavior patterns, and the long-term effects of marketing campaigns, ensuring informed decision-making based on a more robust dataset. Please see your Google Analytics report attached.

To better understand the metrics in the attached report, see below:

* Direct Traffic:
  * Definition: Direct traffic refers to visitors who come directly to your website by typing your URL into their browser or using a bookmark.
* Organic Search Traffic:
  * Definition: Organic search traffic comes from search engine results. When users enter a query into a search engine like Google and click on one of the non-paid (organic) results, their visit is categorized as organic search traffic.
* Referral Traffic:
  * Definition: Referral traffic comes from other websites that link to yours. When users click on a link on another website and land on your site, their visit is categorized as referral traffic.
* Unassigned Traffic:
  * Definition: Unassigned traffic typically refers to visits that Google Analytics couldn't categorize into the three main source types (direct, organic search, or referral). This can happen for various reasons, such as issues with tracking or if the source information is not available.
