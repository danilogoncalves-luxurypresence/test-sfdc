Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

The server error (5xx) is likely a temporary issue on the server side and not a cause for concern. In many cases, this could be due to routine maintenance, temporary glitch, or server overloads for example. It's a general response from the server that something has gone wrong. The problem could have happened when the server requested resources, or it could be an issue with an outdated or corrupted cache and cookies. In such situations, it's often a temporary inconvenience rather than a cause for long-term concern.
