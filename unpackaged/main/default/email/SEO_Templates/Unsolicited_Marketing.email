Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for reaching out to us!

Please be wary of marketing emails from other companies that could be spam:

It's important to exercise caution when dealing with marketing emails from unfamiliar companies. Spam emails often make exaggerated promises and use deceptive tactics.

Here are a few quick giveaways that may help as a reference point moving forward:

* Lacking Specifics - There are no specific examples or recommendations provided.

* Guarantees - I would be wary of any companies/individuals that guarantee results. Google’s algorithm has over 500 ranking factors. Our approach is to follow Google’s recommended best practices and focus on factors we can control, such as technical architecture, on-site optimization, content, and speed.

* Grammar - Look out for improper language.


Best,
SEO Team
