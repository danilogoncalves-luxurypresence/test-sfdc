Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

There is not a set of keywords that we target, and our strategy is designed to target and attract qualified traffic by aligning user search intent, particularly transactional intent. For example, key components of our optimized MLS pages include matching user search intent, custom headers with SEO-optimized subtitles and content, a specific MLS search grid for location, property type, and value, multiple call-to-action points, an embedded properties map, and internal links to related blog content, neighborhood guides, pillar pages, and other Optimized MLS Pages. The optimized MLS pages that are part of your plan are also location based. Here is an example, below. This ensures a comprehensive, user-centric, and SEO-friendly interface that boosts engagement and lead generation.
