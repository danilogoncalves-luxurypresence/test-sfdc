Be wary of marketing emails from other companies that could be spam:

It's important to exercise caution when dealing with marketing emails from unfamiliar companies. Spam emails often make exaggerated promises and use deceptive tactics. 

Your website is being indexed by search engines which is a positive sign. Being indexed is crucial for your website to have any chance of ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs) and driving organic traffic. Indexing means that search engines are aware of your site's existence and are including it in their search results. This is an essential step towards achieving visibility and attracting organic traffic. 

Best,
The SEO Team at Luxury Presence
