Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We understand that you may not be familiar with the intricacies of SEO and digital presence as it can be very complex. To help you improve your online visibility, we've put together a list of simple and effective actions you can take:

1. Metadata Optimizations: We recommend implementing metadata optimizations (aka optimizing the titles & descriptions of pages), which is considered a high-impact SEO move. 
    1. Here is a guide and best practices for SEO titles and descriptions and How to Edit Metadata (SEO Titles and Descriptions) Guide. 
2. Google Business Profile:
  1. Create and verify your Google Business Profile to connect with customers on Google Search and Maps. Use this platform to:
    1. Create Posts: Share updates, featured listings, blog posts, or open house events. Here's a guide on creating posts, and here is a how-to video if you prefer to watch.
    2. Request Reviews: Encourage clients to leave reviews, which builds trust and improves local search results. A great way to increase reviews is by sharing your short review link with clients, which directly takes them to your GBP.
3. Maintain a Consistent Digital Presence: Google Values this acronym known as NAP, which stands for Name, Address, and Phone. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) is crucial for local SEO and maintaining a consistent digital presence, as it improves local search rankings, enhances user experience, and builds trust with customers and search engines. Ensuring NAP consistency across all online platforms helps increase visibility, customer engagement, and ultimately leads to business growth. Some places to check that your information is consistent can be your brokerage page, personal profiles (Google Business, Yelp, Bing Places, etc.), social media, and directories (Realtor, Zillow, Trulia, Redfin, etc.).
  1. Ensure that your information is consistent across the web, including:
    * Business Name
    * Website URL
    * Contact Phone Number
    * Address
    * Service area(s)
4. Create In-Depth Neighborhood Guides:
  1. Develop comprehensive guides for your focus areas, covering property types, architectural styles, the real estate market, and tips on finding a local agent. Also, include lifestyle information such as schools, attractions, and demographics. Instead of fixating on word count, prioritize creating valuable, user-focused content. Search Engines, like google value high-quality content that addresses user needs and provides value, will naturally attract and retain readers, leading to better engagement and improved SEO performance. See examples:
    1. https://susansmithrealty.com/neighborhoods/malibu
    2. https://carmenateduchon.com/neighborhoods/miami-beach
5. Align SEO Priority Locations & Neighborhood Guides:
  1. Make sure your priority locations from the keyword analysis stage match your neighborhood guides. Create dedicated pages for priority locations to help Google associate your site with those areas and relevant keywords.
6. Publish Long-Form Blog Posts:
  1. Continuously add fresh content to your website with relevant blog posts, addressing common questions and providing valuable insights. In other words this is called Topical Depth, this refers to the comprehensive coverage of a specific topic or subject within a piece of content. By providing thorough and in-depth information, a website can demonstrate expertise, authority, and trustworthiness to both users and search engines, which can lead to improved search rankings and user engagement. Adding new sections of relevant content offers the following SEO benefits:
    * Content depth - The more sub-topics you cover, the higher the chance that Google’s users will discover what they’re seeking if Google directs them to your page. Google favors content that goes in-depth on the main topic and covers all the potential information users may seek.
    * Increased engagement - If your content gives users what they’re seeking, they’re more likely to stay on the page and read your content. This leads to increased Time on Page and Session Duration, and decreased Bounce Rate, all of which may correlate with improved rankings.

  * Use H2s and lists to break up content. You can use websites like Unsplash or Pexels to find free stock photos as well. See examples below:

7. One-Click Single Property Listings 

a. Here is our guide on How to Create a One-Click Property Website and here is more information on what is a One-Click Property Site.   https://luxurypresence.my.site.com/helpcenter/s/article/How-to-Create-a-One-Click-Property-Website

1. Build Backlinks:
  1. If your listings or agent profiles appear on local news outlets, blog, or anywhere else request publishers to link back to your website. For example, see this article links back to The Sher Group, and consider reaching out for a "do follow" backlink.
  2. This not only can drive more traffic to your website, but also increased your Domain Authority (DA) or Domain Rating (DR) depending on which SEO Tool you’re using. “Website authority” is an SEO concept that refers to the “strength” of a given domain, and the higher your DA, the great chance you have of moving up in the rankings.
