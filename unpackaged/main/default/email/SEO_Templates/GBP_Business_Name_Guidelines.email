Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Our decision to simplify the name aligns with best practices outlined by Google, ensuring compliance and avoiding potential violations that could impact your platform visibility.

Google emphasizes the importance of a clear and prominent brand name over keyword stuffing. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to enhance your online presence effectively and sustainably. The adjusted name, while concise, strategically optimizes your GBP for search engines, maintaining compliance and attracting your target audience.

To follow Google's guidelines, your business name must represent your real-world identity and exclude unnecessary terms such as real estate, real estate agent, or realtor. Non-compliance may result in visibility issues and potential penalties. Refer to Google's guidelines for more details: Guidelines for representing your business on Google.

For real estate agents classified as individual practitioners, additional information about business name guidelines can be found in the "Individual practitioners" section of the article.
