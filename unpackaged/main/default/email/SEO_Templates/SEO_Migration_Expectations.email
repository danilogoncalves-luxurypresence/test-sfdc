Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for inquiring about an SEO migration!

Below, you will find expectations and details regarding an SEO migration. 

Anytime you have a website redesign, switch website providers, change domains (or a combination of that), you're guaranteed to see a dip in traffic/rankings. An SEO Migration helps minimize that dip and recover quicker. It is possible for us to mitigate some of the loss with migration, but there will be a recovery period involved. For example, we will make the site as similar as possible (page structure, content, metadata, internal links, etc.). Essentially, we transfer content and take a list of current URLs to redirect them to equivalent pages on the new site. This helps both users and Google find the pages so they don’t run into 404 (broken) pages. It is likely that the rankings will be retained, but it will take time for Google to recognize the new site. It's important to emphasize that while not all content is migrated over, our team prioritizes top-performing pages that are ranking well for targeted keywords.

Here's a breakdown of how we handle the SEO migration process and the level of detail we go into:

* SEO Audit and Analysis: Before migration, we conduct a comprehensive audit of your current website's SEO elements, including keywords, meta tags, headings, internal and external links, and more. This helps us understand your website's current SEO standing and identify areas that need special attention during migration. We use this to determine which top-performing pages we will migrate over based on the package and added extra pages.
* Mapping and Redirects: We create a detailed mapping of URLs from your existing website to the new one. This ensures that users and search engines are seamlessly redirected from old pages to corresponding new pages, preventing any loss in traffic and preserving link equity.
* Content Migration: Our team carefully transfers the content from your old website to the new one, ensuring that metadata such as meta titles, descriptions, internal links, or as needed. 
* Technical SEO: We optimize the technical aspects of your new website, like URL structure. This ensures that the new site meets search engine standards and provides an improved user experience.
* XML Sitemap Submission: We generate a new XML sitemap for your redesigned website and submit it to search engines. This helps search engines quickly discover and index your new pages.

Regarding the guarantee of SEO, it's important to note that while we follow industry best practices to maintain SEO, the site can be influenced by various factors beyond our control, such as changes in search algorithms, competitors’ performance, etc.
