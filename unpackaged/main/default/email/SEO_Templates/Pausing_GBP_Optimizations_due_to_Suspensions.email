Hi {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for adding us as an owner to your Google Business Profile (GBP). We have been noticing an influx of suspensions when edits are made right after a new user has been added. To avoid getting suspended and going through that process, we are holding off until we will comfortable that your profile will not get flagged for suspicious activity. We will let you know when optimizations are complete, thank you for understanding, and let us know if you have any additional questions.

Best,

SEO Team at Luxury Presence
