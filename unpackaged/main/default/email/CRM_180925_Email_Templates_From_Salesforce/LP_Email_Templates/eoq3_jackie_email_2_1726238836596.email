<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
Let me know if you're in a position to take advantage of our end-of-quarter pricing before the end of September.&nbsp;With the volatility in the market, it’s a wise time to invest in your brand &amp; online presence. When competitors are cutting back, it’s much easier to garner attention, build an audience, and increase your market share.<br />
I’ll let the numbers speak for themselves with these recent success stories from our clients:
<ul>
	<li>For&nbsp;<a href="https://www.luxurypresence.com/case/gray-st-onge/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gray St. Onge</a>, we drove a 43% increase in website visitors, 30 1st page rankings on Google, and helped them achieve a 67% increase in closed sales since starting the brokerage in 2020.</li>
	<li>For the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.luxurypresence.com/case/dawn-mckenna-group/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dawn McKenna Group</a>, we collaborated to elevate her client experience and help scale her business from 7 to 15 agents in 5 major markets and grow annual sales from $250 million to over $600 million in 2 years.</li>
	<li>For&nbsp;<a href="https://www.luxurypresence.com/case/how-frontgate-real-estate-secured-6m-sale-lead-gen-ads-ai-lead-nurture-stellar-service/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frontgate Real Estate</a>, we helped them successfully close a $6M sale using the tools in our Leads Pro plan.</li>
</ul>
As we approach the last few weeks of the quarter, I’ve secured approval to offer special pricing below what’s typically available—exclusively for clients I’ve met with this year.<br />
<br />
If you have a few minutes this week, I’d love to review these solutions and end-of-quarter discounts with you.<br />

Looking forward to reconnecting,<br />
