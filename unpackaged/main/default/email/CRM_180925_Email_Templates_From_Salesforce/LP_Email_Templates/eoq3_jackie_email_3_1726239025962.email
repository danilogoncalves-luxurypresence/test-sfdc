<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
Checking in to confirm you received my previous email. When we chatted earlier, I got the impression an enhanced online presence was a priority.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you're still considering, now's the time! September 30th is the final day to lock in our best pricing of the year, and I'd hate for you to miss out. My cal is linked below for an easy way to pick a time.<br />

Thanks so much for your time -looking forward to hearing from you either way!<br />
