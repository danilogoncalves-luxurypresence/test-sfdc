Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out with instructions on how to reconnect your Instagram account to your website. Instagram requires accounts to be reconnected every 60 days for security purposes, so if your feed is missing, this is likely the reason.

To reconnect your Instagram account, follow these steps:

1, Log in to your Luxury Presence dashboard.
2. Navigate to Settings and select Integrations.
3. Find the Instagram section and click on the Reconnect button.
4. A pop-up window will appear asking you to log in to Instagram. Make sure you log in using the correct Instagram credentials associated with your account.
5. Once logged in, authorize the connection, and your Instagram feed will be restored to your website.

For more detailed instructions, feel free to check out our guide here:

Let me know if you need any further assistance, and Iâ€™ll be happy to help! 

Best regards,
