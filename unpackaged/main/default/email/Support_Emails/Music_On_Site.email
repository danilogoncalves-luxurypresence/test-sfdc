Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you so much for reaching out!

When it comes to background or auto-play music, we’ve found that it’s no longer a best practice in web design. While it was once a popular feature, many modern websites avoid auto-play audio to provide a better user experience.

In fact, several browsers now block auto-playing music, and Google even released a guide explaining that stricter autoplay policies are being implemented to improve the browsing experience.

Additionally, studies show that auto-play music can increase bounce rates and affect site conversions. It can also cause loading issues, especially on slower devices or connections, which could impact your website’s overall performance.

We always want to ensure your website is performing at its best, so I hope this explanation helps!

All the best,
