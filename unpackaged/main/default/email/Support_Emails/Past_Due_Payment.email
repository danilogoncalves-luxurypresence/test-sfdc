Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We hope this email finds you well. Our records indicate that you may have a past due invoice on your account. We understand that sometimes a payment may be missed on accident, and we're here to ensure that youâ€™re being taken care of. We are looping in our billing team to assist with collecting your payment. We're eager to continue working on your site and delivering the best possible results. As soon as we receive payment, we'll be ready to pick up right where we left off.

All the best,
