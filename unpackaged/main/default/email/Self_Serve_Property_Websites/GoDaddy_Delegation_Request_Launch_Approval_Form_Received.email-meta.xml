    <subject>One Last Step to Launch Your Property Website!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your launch approval! We are excited to get your website live soon. However, we need access to the domain. When we sign into the account it triggers a code that expires after 10 minutes.

Can you please share access to your GoDaddy account by following these steps:

1. Go to your GoDaddy Account Settings. If you&#39;re not already logged in, you&#39;ll be prompted to log in.

2. Click Delegate Access.

3. In the People who can access my account section, click Invite to Access.

4. Enter
NAME: Luxury Presence
EMAIL: propertysites@luxurypresence.com

5. Access level: Products and Domains.

6. Click Invite. GoDaddy will send us an email invitation to access your account.
7. Respond to this email letting me know you granted the access so I can accept. GoDaddy will then send you an email telling you that I did!

Best,

Self Serve Property Websites
