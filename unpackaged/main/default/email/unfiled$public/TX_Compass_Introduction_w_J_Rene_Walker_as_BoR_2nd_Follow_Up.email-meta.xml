    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},    

Hope your week is going great! I wanted to follow up on the previous email. Please note Compass requires their agents to complete the IDX request form before your broker of record can sign the form. 

Let me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help! 

Best Regards,</textOnly>
