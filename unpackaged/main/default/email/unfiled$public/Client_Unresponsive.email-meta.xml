    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}!

I hope you are having a wonderful day! I just wanted to check on this case as I have not received your response. If you have additional questions, Iâ€™ll be more than happy to provide assistance.

I know how busy you must be so feel free to take your time and reply to this email thread when you have a moment. The case will remain open, but I will move on to assist other clients in order to ensure we are assisting clients in a timely manner.


Thanks,

{!User.FirstName}</textOnly>
