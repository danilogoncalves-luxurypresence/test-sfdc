    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Hope your week is going great! I wanted to follow up on the previous email. In order for FMLS to grant IDX data feed approval on your site. The MLS requires agents to request a data access agreement on the FMLS platform. Please see the instructions on how to do this below:

Log in to FMLS.com, go to MyFMLS&gt; Marketplace &gt; Browse Products. From there you can search for “Luxury Presence” in the search bar, and click on our product. On the product details page, you will need to enter the site URL. Please make sure that the URL is in the format: http://www. Then click “Subscribe.” Luxury Presence will receive an approval notification shortly after.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help!

Best Regards,</textOnly>
