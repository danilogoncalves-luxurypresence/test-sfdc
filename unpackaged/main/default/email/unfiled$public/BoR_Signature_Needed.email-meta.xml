    <textOnly>Hi {!Service__c.Contact_First_Name__c},

I hope your week is off to a great start. My name is {!Service__c.OwnerFullName} and I am an IDX Coordinator here at Luxury Presence. I am reaching out to you because we are working with {!Service__c.MLS_Board_Name__c} for their IDX data request for their new website and you are listed as the Broker of Record requested for signature.

Please click HERE to sign the IDX request form.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help!


Best Regards,</textOnly>
