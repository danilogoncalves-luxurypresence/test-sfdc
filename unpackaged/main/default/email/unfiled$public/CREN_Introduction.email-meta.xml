    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

It&#39;s great to e-meet you! My name is [Coordinators Name] and I&#39;m an IDX Coordinator at Luxury Presence. I&#39;m contacting you to start the MLS paperwork process!

In order for us to display IDX data on your website, CREN MLS requires us to have a data access agreement submitted and signed through their portal. The instructions for starting the IDX Request are listed below. Once this process is complete we will be able to display the MLS data on your website&#39;s Home Search Tool! Please know that Luxury Presence will cover any cost associated with the IDX Setup. Please notify me or your Implementation manager if you receive an invoice of any kind!

CREN MLS IDX procedure for signing up new IDX Participant/Subscribers:

1. Please to go crenmls.com/getidx and fill out the IDX Authorization Request Form. You will need to input the domain you will be using for the website as well as the staging link. Please let me know if you do not have a domain, or need assistance with gathering your staging link.
2. CREN MLS will craft the Participant Data Access Agreement, e-sign for signatures and invoice for the setup fee. CREN must receive all signatures and the invoice paid before the property data search is authorized.
3. CREN MLS will perform an audit of the site. If compliant, authorize activation of the property data search contingent to a compliance review for final approval.
4. When notified that the search is active, CREN MLS will perform the final compliance review. If compliant, CREN MLS will give final approval authorizing for the site to go live.

Let me know if you have any questions about the IDX Request process. I&#39;m here to help!

All the best,</textOnly>
