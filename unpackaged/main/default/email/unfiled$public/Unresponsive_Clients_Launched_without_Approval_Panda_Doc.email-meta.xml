    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},    

It&#39;s great to e-meet you! My name is {IDX COORDINATOR NAME} and I&#39;m an IDX Coordinator at Luxury Presence. I&#39;m contacting you because we are conducting an audit of our MLS Feeds on agent websites. It appears that the required paperwork for the MLS currently being displayed on your website is incomplete. 

In order for us to display IDX data on your website, Contact: MLS Board Name requires us to have a data access agreement signed.

You may complete your end of the paperwork by signing here.

Please note if we do not receive a signed data access agreement we will need to hide the home search tool on your site. 

Let me know if you have any questions. I&#39;m here to help. 

Regards,</textOnly>
