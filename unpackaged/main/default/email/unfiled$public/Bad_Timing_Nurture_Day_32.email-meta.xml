    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName} ,

We know that a strong online presence is essential for any successful real estate business.

If you&#39;re not quite ready to get started, that&#39;s okay. But we&#39;d still love the opportunity to show you what Luxury Presence can do—from our customized websites to our smart tools, including our Digital CMA integration, Instant Property Sites, and On-Demand Ads™.

If you&#39;re interested in seeing how we&#39;ve helped other real estate professionals, check out our case studies here.

Whenever you have questions or would like to learn more, feel free to book a time on my calendar.

Let me know how I can help.

Best,
