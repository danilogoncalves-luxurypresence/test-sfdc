    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName} ,

I wanted to touch base and see if you have some time to catch up and discuss your website and digital marketing needs.

Luxury Presence helps real estate agents like you create beautiful, eye-catching websites and build their brands. We&#39;d love to help you elevate your online presence and win more business.

If you&#39;re interested in learning more, feel free to schedule a quick chat with me. I promise it’ll be worth the time! Every agent who scheduled time with me and explored our offerings has told me they&#39;ve learned something new.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
