    <textOnly>Hi {!Service__c.Contact_First_Name__c},

Hope your week is going great! I wanted to follow up on the previous email. Have you received the Indemnity Agreement from Compass? Please note Compass requires their agents to complete the Indemnity Agreement before your broker of record can sign the IDX request form.

Let me know if you have any questions, I am happy to help!

Best Regards,</textOnly>
