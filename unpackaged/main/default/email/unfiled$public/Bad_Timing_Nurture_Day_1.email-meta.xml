    <subject>Following up from Luxury Presence</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Thanks for considering Luxury Presence, even if the timing’s not quite right for you at the present moment.

In the future, I’d love to show you more about how our award-winning design and digital marketing solutions can help you build your brand and grow your business. You can see how we’ve helped other real estate agents, teams, and brokerages elevate their online presences here.

In the meantime, let’s stay in touch. I’ll plan to check in with you periodically to see how you&#39;re doing and if your technology needs have changed.

And if you have any questions or would like to revisit the conversation, feel free to book a time on my calendar.

Thanks for your time, {!Contact.FirstName}. Looking forward to talking again soon.

Best,
{!User.Name}
