    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},    

I hope you are having a great day! I&#39;m following up with our previous email, have you had a chance to complete the requested data access agreement?

Please note if we do not receive a signed data access agreement we will need to hide the home search tool on your site. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything from me. I&#39;m here to help!

Regards,</textOnly>
