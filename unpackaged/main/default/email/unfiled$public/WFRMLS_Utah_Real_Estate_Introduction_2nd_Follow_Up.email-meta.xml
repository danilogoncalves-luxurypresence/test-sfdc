    <textOnly>Hi {!Service__c.Contact_First_Name__c}â€‹,

Hope your week is going great! I wanted to follow up on the previous email. Utah Real Estate / Wasatch Front Regional MLS, Inc. requires agents to initiate the IDX Request process. Here is the instruction sheet that outlines the required step and helps with the paperwork process: Instructions.

Let me know if you have any questions. I&#39;m here to help!

Best Regards,</textOnly>
