    <subject>Get Started on the Luxury Presence Platform Upgrade</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi Agent Name

I hope you are having a wonderful day. Luxury Presence is thrilled to announce the upgrade of the website Website Domain to the new Presence™ Platform! With this upgrade, you’ll experience a more modern and responsive editor that makes editing your website smoother, faster, and simply more enjoyable --- Oh, and you’ll also gain access to more elevated features!

To get started we require updated Domain Registrar credentials to make the switch since we host it on a different server. Please choose from the options below:

Send via email your username and password -OR-
By phone, please pick a time by scheduling a call Here

While your website design will remain the same, there will be minor design enhancements built into the upgrade. Lastly, once your site is live on the new platform, I&#39;ll be reaching out with another email inviting you to the new platform. We&#39;ll also have various webinars you can sign up to attend and of course, our support team will be there to answer any questions along the way :)


Best,


Luxury Presence Inc., 1808 Stanford Street, Santa Monica, California 90404, United States, 3109551077</textOnly>
