    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

It&#39;s {!User.Name} from Luxury Presence. It&#39;s been a while since we last spoke, and I hope you&#39;re doing well.

I wanted to check in and see if you&#39;re still interested in exploring ways to improve your website and digital marketing efforts. Our platform helps real estate agents and teams stand out online and close more deals, and weâ€™d be thrilled to do the same for your business.

We have some new features that might interest you, and I&#39;d love to hear about any changes or challenges you&#39;re facing in your business.

If you have some time, let&#39;s catch up on a call. You can schedule a meeting with me here: [Meeting Link]

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
{!User.Name}</textOnly>
