    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to quickly follow up about our end-of-month offer to discount all website setup fees. This offer is only available for a limited time and is expiring soon.

I don&#39;t want you to miss out on this chance to elevate your online presence and stand out from the competition.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best,
