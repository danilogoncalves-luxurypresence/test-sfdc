    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I wanted to reach out one last time to see if you&#39;re interested in getting a beautiful real estate website for a discounted cost. Our team is ready to take your brand to the next level.

We only have a few slots left for your market this month, so if you&#39;re interested in taking advantage of this opportunity, let&#39;s chat and see how we can help you.

Don&#39;t miss out on this chance to stand out in a crowded market. Book a meeting today using this link: [Meeting Link].

Kind regards,
