    <textOnly>Hey {!Service__c.OwnerFirstName} ,

The service {!Service__c.Name}, with subscription date: {!Service__c.Subscription_start_date__c} is to begin in 5 days.

IMPORTANT: If the client&#39;s start date needs to be extended, please use the following guidelines:

If 30 days or less, revise the extension date field under the service (please check to make sure the client has not already been billed). If they&#39;ve been billed, a credit request needs to be submitted instead.

If more than 30 days is needed, please create an extension addendum.
Please ensure this is taken care of before the client is billed to prevent escalation. n.</textOnly>
