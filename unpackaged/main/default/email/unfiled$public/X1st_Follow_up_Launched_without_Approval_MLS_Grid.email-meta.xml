    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},    

I hope you are having a great day! I&#39;m following up with our previous email, can you provide the necessary information so that we may draft the necessary paperwork to send to required parties for signature?

Please note if we do not receive a signed data access agreement we will need to hide the home search tool on your site. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything from me. I&#39;m here to help!

Regards,</textOnly>
