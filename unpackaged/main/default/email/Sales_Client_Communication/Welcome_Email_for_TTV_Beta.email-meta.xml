    <textOnly>Hi {!Account.Primary_Contact_First_Name__c},

Welcome to Luxury Presence! We&#39;re thrilled to have the opportunity to work together and help elevate your digital presence.

Shortly, you will receive an invitation to our platform, which will allow you to start the initial onboarding process and begin creating your brand new website. 

To ensure a seamless experience, we have scheduled a call with you and your Onboarding Specialist, {OM Name}. They will be working with you to complete your initial onboarding setup on a Zoom call about 2 business days from today. On this call, you will review the information you provided in the platform and wrap up any details to ensure a smooth onboarding. From there, {OM Name} will continue to be your main point of contact throughout your onboarding journey.  

Please feel free to reach out to your assigned Onboarding Specialist if you need any assistance.  {OM Name} is cc’d on this email and is here to provide support and ensure that everything runs smoothly for you.

Timeline of Process

* Please accept the Presence invite immediately (from support@luxurypresence.com)
* Please complete the initial onboarding within the next 2 business days
* Please attend your technical onboarding call that was pre-scheduled
* We will begin the buildout of your website upon the completion of your technical onboarding call

Should you have any further inquiries, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask. I&#39;m always available to help.
