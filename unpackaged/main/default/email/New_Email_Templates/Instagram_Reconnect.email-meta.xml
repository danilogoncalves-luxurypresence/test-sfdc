    <subject>How to Reconnect Your Instagram Account ðŸ“¸</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

I hope you&#39;re having a great day! I wanted to share instructions on how to reconnect your Instagram account to your website.

Instagram requires accounts to be reconnected every 60 days for security purposes, so if your feed is missing, this is likely the reason.

To reconnect your Instagram account, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Luxury Presence dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings and select Integrations
3. Find the Instagram section and click Reconnect
4. A pop-up window will appear asking you to log in to Instagram. Make sure you log in using the correct Instagram credentials associated with your account.
5. Once logged in, authorize the connection, and your Instagram feed will be restored to your website.

Many agents will set a calendar reminder to log in once a month or so and reauthorize the connection, resetting the 60 day countdown.

This article from our Help Center goes over the process in more detail:

Let me know if you need any further assistance, and Iâ€™ll be happy to help!
